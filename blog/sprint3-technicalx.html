       <h4>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS </h4>
        <p class='techtext'>
          I've been thinking for a while and the only analogy that I came up with its about drag queens.
          My Brain it's quite burnt already!
    <br> <br>
          Like RuPaul always says... We all born naked and the rest is CSS!
    <br> <br>
          HTML will be us (a person) being naked... the plane and simple US.
    <br> <br>
          By wearing clothings and accesories we are adding CSS onto ourselves.  class='pants', class='hats', class='rings' class='wigs!' and all of that...
        <br>  Every class or ID has properties as well like color, size etc.
        <br>
          The simple and plain HTML will not generate/recreate the same type of experience without CSS.

      <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h4>

        <p class='techtext'>Control flow on washing my clothes?<br><br>  Pick up the pile<br>Put it into the washing<br>Put some soap on the machine<br>Press RUN<br>Wait for 2 hours<br>Grab the clothes<br>Put them into the dryier<br>Press RUN<br>Wait for 2 hours<br>Clean/dry clothes! </p>

    <p class='techtext'>A good description of a loop could be my life during lockdown:<br><br>

    Waking up, breakfast, work til 5, dinner, fall sleep...<br><br>
    Waking up, breakfast, work til 5, dinner, and again....<br><br>
    Waking up, breakfast, work til 5, dinner, and againnnnnn... x_x <br><br>
    Waking up, breakfast, work til 5, dinner ...... <br><br>

    <br><br> and that loop stopped when we went to lv 3.

       <h4>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h4>

<p class="techtext">The DOM means Document Object Model and its an interface that allows javascript to work with the HTML and CSS content of the webpage<br><br>
You can make use of the DOM APIs to play around with all the elements that are available on the page.</p>



       <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h4>
<p class='techtext'>If you want to access data from an array you will need to call it like this:<br><br> nameofthearray[numberoftheitemonthearray]
<br><br>But of course you will need to declare that array first... <br><br>here you have a picture:</p>

<br>
<br>
<p class='techtext'>ooooopsss not that one!</p>
<br>
<p class='techtext'>this one's better:</p>
<br>

<p class='techtext'>If you want to access data from an object you will do so like this: <br><br> nameoftheobject.propertyoftheobject  <br><br> In case that the object has a property that has a space you will do it like this: <br><br> nameoftheobject."property with space"</p>


<p class='techtext'>But of course you will need to declare that object first... <br><br>here you have a picture:</p>

       <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h4>

       <p class='techtext'>Functions are like little machine (or big ones)... were you can introduce something on it and it will return something else through the other side.
         <br>Each Function or Machine it's configured to always do the same procedure and depending if some conditions are passed... it will do take actions.
         <br>
         <br>
         Functions are very useful because we can save an infinte amount of time  by just declaring it once... we can reuse it as much as we like and provide different values each time.

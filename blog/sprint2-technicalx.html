       <h6>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h6>

         <h3><img src="https://img.icons8.com/android/24/000000/snowflake.png"/>   IDs are unique and beautiful snowflakes <img src="https://img.icons8.com/android/24/000000/snowflake.png"/>
           <br> Classes are not. </h3>

           <br>
           <br>
           <h4>The use of classes/IDs</h4>

           <p class='techtext'>Classes and IDs are made for you to be able to link and give styles to texts or boxes.
         <br><br>If you dont assign them into an element... nothing will happen. The element will need to have the class attached into it like this:
       <br><br>
         <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/hVVjT2v/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-1-19-31-PM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-1-19-31-PM" border="0"></a>
         <br><br>
         The text 'text to be enlarged' will be affected by that "bigfont" class.<br> We will declare the class 'bigfont' and give different attributes and styles to it on the CSS stylesheet.
         <br><br><a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/8XkPsNL/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-1-01-46-PM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-1-01-46-PM" border="0"></a>
         <br><br>

         You don't always need to create a class and assign it into an element... but it's best practice and more organized to do it like that.
       <br><br>
         This is the way that you will assing style to a paragraph without attaching it to a class.
         </p>
         <p class='techtext'>



       <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/6g4Vkt7/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-1-16-18-PM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-1-16-18-PM" border="0"></a>


       <br>
       <br>This can be a bit messy and unorganized but it's OK if you do it. In the long term it will be better to have classess and IDs instead of single styles attached to elements.
       <br>


       <h4>The Difference between Classes and IDs</h4>

       <p class='techtext'>An ID works exactly like a class... Everything that I've written at the top applies to IDs as well.

       So what’s the difference?
       <br><br>
       An ID is identified by a # and a class is identified by a .
       <br><br>
       aaaaand...
       <br><br>
       An ID can only be used once per HTML page but the class can be used over and over again.


       <br><br> You will declared them like this:<br>
       <br>
       ID<br>
       <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XZ2Db8Q/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-12-16-55-PM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-12-16-55-PM" border="0"></a>
       <br><br>CLASS<br><a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/8XkPsNL/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-1-01-46-PM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-1-01-46-PM" border="0"></a>

       <br>
       <br>
       An analogy of this bar codes and serial numbers. Let's say that you buy an Ipod on a store... This Ipod will have a barcode. The barcode has information about this product eg: how much it cost and maybe which type of Ipod it is etc. All the Ipods of the same type/year will share the same barcode as they are gonna be priced the same $$. <br>This will be a class.
       <br>
       <br>
       This Ipod will have as well a specific serial number that I like to call 'system ID'. This sysID will be unique to it as there's not gonna be a similar one in the world. This will be the ID.
       <br>
       <br>

       <br>

       <h4>Using Classes and IDs Semantically</h4>


       <p class='techtext'>
       It's important to have simple, useful and clear names when declaring this type of classes or IDs.
       <br><br>
       We can ask ourselves a few questions to get this right:
       <br><br>
       <ul class='techtext'>
       <li>What's the function/purpose of the element that I'm gonna be assigned the class/ID to?</li>
       <br><br>
       <li>Is it the only element of it's type on the webpage? EG. How many menus does your page has? Maybe a left menu and a top menu?</li>
       </ul>
       <p class='techtext'>
       <br>
       Answering the first question: Let's say that the purpose of the element that we are tagging is to be a search input field on the page. We can use something like 'searchfield'.
       <br><br>
       Answering the second question: It's possible that you will have more than 1 element of that type on the page, so it’s useful to call this particular element something besides just 'searchfield'.
       <br><br>
       You could declare the class/id based on where this searchfield its possitionated on the page... Could be on the top menu and we could use something like 'topsearchfield' or 'leftsearchfield'.
       <br>
       <br>
       </p>

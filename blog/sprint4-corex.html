         <h4>Research Neuroplasticity</h4>

          <h4>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h4>

<p class="techtext">Neuroplasticity’s facts:
<br><br>
Brain its an always changing elastic organ: By knowing that... you are aware that the more that you practice or do something... the easier and more comfortable it will be come for you on a long term. This is because the neurones paths get fired up every time that you think  or do that task physically. If you are very aware of that you get an extra drive on the things wanna learn or do and in the long term you get to master those stuff.

<br>

<h4>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit
</h4>
<br>
<p class="techtext">I’ve begin meditating a few months ago, but I have been doing it around 3 times per week. It helped me quite a lot...<br>
At the beginning of sprint 3 we got this challenge where we had to download this HeadSpace app and we got committed to meditate everyday. <br>
By doing this... the neurones paths that get fired up when I do my meditation will strengthen on a daily basis... Since I started I’ve always wanted to get better at this to be able to get the most out of it. I feel that now that I’m gonna be doing this so often, it will become easier and easier on the long term and its’ gonna benefit me big times.
</p
<br>
<br>

<h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h4>
<br>

<p class="techtext">By thinking about the task or by doing it !<br>

<h4>Research Growth Mindset</h4>
<br>
<h4>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h4>

<p class="techtext">Growth mindset it’s knowing that you can learn new stuff even tho you might think that ‘You are not the type of person that eg: goes to the gym.. or meditates,’<br>
Being aware that how you think about a situation will condition your results... If you think that you can’t and you are not gonna learn maths it will definitely make it harder for you to get good at it.<br>
If you embark on a learning journey of something new with a Growth Mindset it will definitely give you best results.<br>
 <br> <br>
</p>


<h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
 <p class="techtext"> We saw this already on the first sprint didn’t we..? So no. I knew this stuff already, always interesting tho. </p>


<h4>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>

<p class="techtext"> When something challenging comes up I’ll definitely see it like that specific neurone path its just ‘strong’ enough yet lol
By getting practice out of out and doing it over and over it will definitely  get stronger and on the long term it will feel easier. </p>

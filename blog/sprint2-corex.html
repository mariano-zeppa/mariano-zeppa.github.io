         -What is your long term goal and or career pathway?
         <br>
         <br>
After finishing with the bootcamp I would like to get hired as a back end web developer and eventually end up working on DevOps.
<br>
<br>
-What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
<br>
<br>
I would like to be able to build a plan, stick to it and follow it... That will require Organization and Constancy.
<br>
<br>
-A description of your own strengths and limitations
<br><br>
Strengths:<br>
<br>

Intuitive<br>
Insightful<br>
Passionate<br>
Sentitive<br>
Adaptability<br>
<br>
Limitations:<br><br>

Sensitive<br>
Perfectionistic<br>
Anxious<br>


<br><br>

-Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
<br><br>
Once I get the workload I would see how much time this might take... If I feel that I’m not gonna be able to finish it in time I’ll speak up. I will put as much time as It’s needed to get the work done.

<br><br>
-A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
<br><br>
If I need some type of support or help I’ll talk with my facilitator on slack.
<br><br>
-A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
<br><br>
Emotional support?  :P and patience.
<br><br>
-Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
<br><br>
I don’t have anything like that scheduled.
<br><br>

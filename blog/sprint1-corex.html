       <br>

       I had a friend that came to NZ from Argentina last year. I got her a job with my partner’s family as a Nanny. She has always been super nice with everybody and everyone liked her. After some time my partners family and my friend from Argentina started to get into fights for different work/life balance reasons, as she was living in the same house that she was working as a Nanny. I was in the middle of that because she was my friend and on the other side there was my partners family as well. She ended up quitting the job badly, a lot of drama... My partner’s family started saying that my friend was a horrible person.... That she deleted some files from a laptop that they lended her and that she written offensive stuff on different parts of the house.
       Everyone was against my friend and I didn’t knew who to believe. She was saying that my partners family were crazy and even my partner got to start hating her for that.
       I decided to believe on my friend and that costed me some fights with my partner. I feel that my relationship with my partner kinda broke a bit because of me believing on my friend. <br> <br>

       -Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
        <br>
         <br>




       Argentinian people are very straight up and because of that sometimes we can come as abrasive and rude.
       I remember that during the first year of living in NZ people were calling me rude very often for things that I was saying. It was quite shocking for me because I always though that I was a nice and kind person back in Argentina and I remember that those comments were quite hurtful at the time.
       We have a very clear sense of who we are and our identity and when you come into a new country people don’t really get that as they might not be used to it... So we have to adapt.
       Back where I’m from it’s very common for people to talk about emotions and how we feel. People do therapy and it’s a normal and healthy thing to do...
       Here in NZ it’s not that common and people assume that if you go to therapy its because you have mental problems.
       People here in NZ exercise a lot to feel good about themselves and ‘silence’ those little demons in our heads... and not many people talks about it.

       -Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development<br><br>
 <br>
       I find web development super interesting and its something that I’ve always wanted to properly learn... now that I have the opportunity  my passion and driven will help me to achieve the learning.
       I’ve been able to Adapt onto to many situations since I moved from Argentina to NZ.... The cultural shock was big at the time but now I fell that being on a position where you get challenged its the best way of improving and learning about yourself. This boootcamp will put me on the edge and being able to Adapt to the workload and the new routine its gonna help me a lot.

       My anxiety will def play a role into this journey... I’ve been working on it for some time now and I’ve been able to use the tools that I got to calm it down. The meditations and the yoga classes will help me with that one :)

       <br>
       -Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
       <br>
       <br>

       Passionate/Drive
       <br>
       <br>
       I’ve been interested on code and development since I finished with high school... I had opportunities where I could have studied it but I remember not being on the best scenario at that point... There were different priorities at the time. Even tho I did a short course on web development it wasn’t enough. After working for quite a few years on the industry and getting a deeper knowledge on development I found myself with enough time, money, and this opportunity to take on. I’m quite passionate about the things that I like and coding is one of those.... I will use the passion that I got for it in this learning journey to overcome possible learning obstacles.

       -Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</p>


       <p class="techtext">On my last job for a client I was given defects to fix and I was aware that they were gone take more time that the time that I was allowed to claim for on my company.
       There was 2 hours per defect but I had to investigate for 10 hours to be able to fix it.
       After some time of me working on those defects I had to talk with my PM to tell him the issue.
       I guess next time that I get into a situation like this I would straight away call it out to avoid misunderstandings and maybe some possible tension from both sides.

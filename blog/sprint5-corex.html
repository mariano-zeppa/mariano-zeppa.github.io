         <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>

         <p class="techtext"> That I’m very hard on myself very often... that I get frustrated when I cannot solve something and that even tho I think that I’m very aware and that I can control my emotions... those emotions control me very easily when things get shaky.</p>

         <h4>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>

          <p class="techtext">Values: understanding others values and our own ones could be very helpful to connect with people that we don’t know easily.<br><br>
         Self awareness: knowing that under stressful situations I would behave and react emotionally? And being aware of that and go and meditate?  Lol<br><br><br>
         Empathy: being able to understand what the other person might be going thru emotionally could be very helpful to know what to say or how to act to avoid fights?</p>


         <h4> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>

          <p class="techtext">I guess the growth and fixed mindset part... Where it says that just by having that idea in your head your learning journey can change drastically... on a good way.</p>

         <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>

          <p class="techtext">The S1 where we had to do introductions of ourselves  and describe strengths and weaknesses and personal values. That’s something that I’ve never though before.</p>

         <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>

         <p class="techtext"> I think that it’s because the school wants to make sure that we are able to tackle interviews and that we are a good fit for a developer teams...</p>

        <h4> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>

         <p class="techtext"> Not at all... I hope that the learning that I’ve been doing in terms of knowing myself will pay off when I need to answer interview questions like the type of ’name your main strength’ lol
         The daily meditation its helping me to think a bit on a different way and with a  different perspective...</p>

 <h8>Preparing for Bootcamp</h8><br><br>

 <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>

 <p class="techtext">I would like to get a job as a full time developer front end... back end... not sure yet tbh... But I do wanna get fully immerse in code to get enough experience to in a year from now be able to move into DevOps.</p>

 <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>



 <p class="techtext">I guess I discovered that I can get very frustrated when things don’t work the way I want them to... and that affects my mood quite a lot lol.</p>


 <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>

 <p class="techtext">I guess the challenge for me will be BEING overwhelmed with the amount of work but being OK with being overwhelmed and not letting it drive me crazy lol.
 I feel that I will be able to adapt quickly to the bootcamp and the amount of work that it will need weekly.</p>


 <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h4>

 <p class="techtext">Receiving feedback and not taking it too personal...
 I would like to improve my public speaking as well</p>

 <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>

 <p class="techtext">Once I get sucked with something ill spend some time trying to figure it out by myself and If that doesn’t work ill reach out to a peer or a facilitator.  I’ll put as much time it takes to finish my part of the job so it doesn’t interfere with other parts of the project. I guess ill be able to respond to this question further on the bootcamp when I get an idea of how its gonna be.</p>

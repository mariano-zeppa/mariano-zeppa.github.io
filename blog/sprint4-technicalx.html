<h8>Got blocked on a simple problem </h8>
<p class="techtext">

<h4>What was the problem?</h4>
<p class="techtext">
There was quite a few problems that I've got blocked on...
We can talk about the Bulk Up Kata where I had to add the win function property on each element of an array.
</p>

<h4>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h4>


  <p class="techtext">
    It was a lot of googling for different methods and how to connect it with the variables and other methods that I had already on the solution.
    I did some pseudocode as well on comments and on my mind and I spoke with my duck too :)
  </p>

<h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>


  <p class="techtext">
    Challenged... and sometimes lost!  But after I get to crack the code it feels nice and it makes me want to keep working on the next ones.
  </p>


<h4>What did you learn?</h4>

<p class="techtext">

I think I learnt to console.log properly and the googling stuff too... MDN its the best page! Thanks Emily Facilitator :P
</p>
<br>
<h8>Solved a problem in an elegant way:</h8>

<h4>What was the problem?</h4>

<p class="techtext">
the 'We Built this City' kata was quite elegant i would say :P
<br><br>

<br><br>
Elegant, right? I guess?

</p>

<h4>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h4>
<br>
<p class="techtext">I guess when I solved this problem my mind was already very javascripty (?) so it was simple and it made sense to do that... but still was elegant i think. ha
</p>
<br>
<h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
<br>
<p class="techtext">I feel that I chose a very simple kata as the 'elegant way problem' so I don't think that I can respond this question with much content....
The process was simple... i guess one google search on how to add and object with properties on an array or something like that.
</p>
<br>

<h4>What did you learn?</h4>

<p class="techtext">Things can be super simple sometimes!</p>

<h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h4>
<ul class='techtext'>
<li>Pseudocode</li> <br> I feel confident that I can use it when I need it.<br><br>
<li>Trying something</li>  <br>Very confident. I try different solutions always but I guess sometimes its better to TRY one of the other problem solving techniques first.<br><br>
<li>Rubber ducky method</li> <br>We are starting to get to know each other. He listens to me, you know... seems genuine.<br><br>
<li>Reading error messages</li> <br>Confident. There's quite a few commong error messages that I know what the mean now.<br><br>
<li>Console.logging</li> <br>This one is the best troubleshooting tool of all. You get to keep a line by line type of evaluation? IDK... Feel confident.<br><br>
<li>Googling</li> <br>Very confident. Thanks StackOverflowwww<br><br>
<li>Asking your peers for help</li> <br>I went directly to my coach... No practice asking help to my peers. But still feel confident that I could.<br><br>
<li>Asking coaches for help</li> <br>I asked some stuff to Emily. Felt confident doing that.<br><br>
<li>Improving your process with reflection</li> <br>Confident.<br><br>
</ul>
